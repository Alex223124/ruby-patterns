Design Patterns in Ruby
=======================

## What is a design pattern?

Design patterns provide solutions to commonly occurring problems. "[Software design] Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system." [1][wiki-design-patterns]

While the techniques, solutions, and best practices highlighted here are rooted in the Ruby language, the intention is to provide utility to any software developer writing in any language.

## Inspiration

This is 100% inspired by the concepts outlined in Russ Olsen's excellent [Design Patterns In Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452) book. I highly recommend picking it up.
